## Summary
A UofT campus exploration app where students can check-in to landmarks across campus. UofT Passport encourages exploration and engagement with the university environment, allowing users to check in at points of interest, plan routes, and track their progress.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to browse a list of UofT landmarks so that I can see what places I can visit and learn more about each one.
2. As a user, I want to “check in” to a location so that my visit is recorded in my passport.
3. As a user, I want to view my overall progress (e.g., number of landmarks visited, a filled passport, a pinned map) so that I can track my exploration achievements.
4. As a user, I want to plan a route that visits multiple landmarks so that I can efficiently explore several locations in one trip.
5. As a user, I want to leave private notes on places I’ve visited so that I can remember experiences or tips.
6. As a user, I want to see all my past visits and undo a visit.
7. As a user, I want to filter the list of landmarks by different parameters (number of visits, landmark type)
8. As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete my note on a place I’ve visited.
